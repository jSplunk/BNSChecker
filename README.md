# BNSChecker
A Script which checks if you have been playing BNS (Blade and Soul) for too long.

# How to use
* Start by checking if the paths are correct in the batch file
* Save the changes (if any were made)
* Run the batch file

Enjoy the script :D

If you want to change the amount of minutes until shutdown of the application, the variable is called:
```python
amount_of_minutes_utill_kill
```
The default value is 
```
120
```


# Licence information

I converted the file format to .wav from .flac for it to work with my script.
